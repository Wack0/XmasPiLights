# XmasPiLights  
The code behind the \#XmasPiLights campaign.

Server-side code is located in the `serverside` directory, client-side code intended to be ran on a Raspberry Pi in the `piclient` directory.

Some of the code was rather rushed, bug reports and pull requests would be appreciated.

If you wish to run this yourself, please read ALL the readmes for information about how to install and run each project.
